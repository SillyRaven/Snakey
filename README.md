# Snakey

## Why did it change my perspective?
    {
        It changed my perspective of coding to see how different things can be used to make a cute game and then that game can have an AI implemented to show advance tactics to play the game at unhuman speeds

        Programming a snake game there are a lot of online resources to help and that minimizes the need for intense problem solving but when you solve an issue that is unique to you or your program there is a sense of satisfaction in that.

        The problem the program solves is bordem and a new way of playing the game
